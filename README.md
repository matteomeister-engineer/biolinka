# Biosensor Discovery Engine

This project mines environmental and AlphaFold-predicted proteins to discover novel ligand-binding scaffolds for biosensor engineering.

## Setup

1. Install Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda).
2. Create and activate the environment:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate biosensor
